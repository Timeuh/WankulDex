# 🎴 WankulDex
The Wankuldex is a website allowing you to see and manipulate Wankul cards.

Wankul cards are created by Wankil Studio, a duo of French streamers and youtubers, and based on their characters, named Wankuls.

#### ⚠️The site is currently only available in French for the subtitles and section titles, but it will not prevent you from enjoying the cards.

### You can see the working site at [Wankuldex](https://wankuldex.timeuh.fr).

## 🗔 What you can do
### 🏠 Home page
When you go on the site, you land in the home page (logic), where you will see a disclaimer about Wankul cards and their creators.

Below, you will be able to see and preview every Wankul card, sorted on their type : field or character card.

When clicking a card, you will see a preview with the card image and a button to go to details page of this card.

You will be able to move your mouse on the card image and see it move, and sometimes shine depending on its rarity.

This is my first Next Js project, so it was tough to familiarize with concepts such as ``server-side rendering``.

I loved using all the tools provided by Next Js like the ```app``` directory for routing, which is great.
